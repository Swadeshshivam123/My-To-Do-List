# My-To-Do-List
A simple My To Do List App created using NodeJS for backend, ExpressJS as template engine, MongoDB for database and HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend designing.

Functionalities: We can add "to do" tasks by assigning them a description, choosing a category for the task and assigning a date and time stamp for the task. The task created is pushed into the database and is displayed on the "display-tasks section" of the app. Once certains tasks are completed or we feel like to cross them from the list, we've option to select multiple tasks by clicking on their checkboxes and then deleting them from the database by hitting "delete tasks" button. Once deleted, the updated tasks in the database are displayed on the "display-task" dection of thr app. contact details by submitting request through a form and the request will be updated in the database. We also have the option to delete the chosen contact(s) from the database and display the updated contact list on the app.
