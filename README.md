# My-To-Do-List
A simple My To Do List App created using NodeJS for backend, ExpressJS and EJS as template engines, MongoDB for database and HTML, CSS and Javascript for frontend designing.

Functionalities: We can add "to do" tasks by assigning them a description, choosing a category for the task and assigning a date and time stamp for the task. The task created is pushed into the database and is displayed on the "display-tasks" section of the app. Once certains tasks are completed or we feel like to cross them from the list, we've option to select multiple tasks by clicking on their checkboxes and then deleting them from the database by hitting "delete tasks" button. Once deleted, the updated tasks in the database are displayed on the "display-task" section of the app.


Tech Stack used: NodeJS, expressJS, EJS,  MongoDB, mongoose, HTML, CSS, Javascript.
